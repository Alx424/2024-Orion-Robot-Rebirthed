# 2024-Orion-Robot-Rebirthed
Code by 5036 "The Robo Devils" for our 2024 Offseason Robot.

## Concept
Based on the 2024 Season game,our robot's goal is to pick up notes (orange foam disks) and shoot/place them in designated areas known as Speakers and Amps.

The robot uses an under-the-bumper intake at the end of a turret-like shooter that rotates vertically to aim and shoot out notes. The intake itself is made up of rolling disks that pick up the notes when they pass under the bumper. The notes are then pushed through the turret to the outtake side where larger disks shoot it them out.
